## What is Shubat?
Shubat is a purpose-made discord bot that does a whole bunch of random things. To be honest, you probably don't want to actually use Shubat on your own server because it's so specifically tailord for the server that the author and their friends use. But if you want, you can check out how the code works and steal some of its features for your own use.

## Features
- Art repost detection
  - You can designate art channels for shubat to monitor. If an art piece is reposted, the offender will be bonked and their repost will be deleted. Currently, Shubat can recognize Twitter and Pixiv links.
  - Is there a situation where you HAVE to repost something? type "!pause" and messages over the next 60 seconds will not be checked.
